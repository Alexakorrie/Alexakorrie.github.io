			<p>	Childhood poverty is a problem that affects millions of children in the United States daily. </p>

			<p>
			The causes of childhood poverty are complex, but directly related to adult poverty. While some pinpoint topics like financial struggles, the cause relates to more than just one issue. It stems from what is called <a href="https://www.mppn.org/multidimensional-poverty/what-is-multidimensional-poverty/">multidimensional poverty</a>, where families experience overlapping challenges such as low income, lack of access to quality education, healthcare, stable housing, or childcare. </p>
		
			<p>According to The Annie E. Casey Foundation, about 11.4 million kids in the United States live below the federal poverty line. Children who live in poverty are more likely to experience food insecurity, homelessness, and other hardships like cognitive delays and educational difficulties. These effects are not limited to the individual level. Poor children are more likely to carry these hardships into adulthood and then pass them onto their children, which can have a negative impact on the economy as a whole and create the cycle of poverty.
